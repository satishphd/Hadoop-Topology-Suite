Hadoop-Topology-Suite
=====================
Supports Polygon Overlay and Geometric Set operations namely Polygon Intersection, Union, Difference and Spatial Indexing 
using MapReduce and Hadoop. The implementation is based on the paper "MapReduce algorithms for GIS Polygonal Overlay 
Processing". For more details: http://cs.gsu.edu/~dimos/sites/default/files/MapReduce%20algorithms%20for%20GIS%20Polygonal%20Overlay%20Processing.pdf

Uses third party R-tree implementation for filtering potentially intersecting polygons and Java port of General Polygon Clipping library by Daniel Bridenbecker.
